/*******************************************************************************

   Computes the length of a vector as
     y = sqrt(sum(x^2))
   where the square operation is element-wise.

   The derivatives w.r.t. to all inputs are computed using adjoint mode AD,
   where the summing of the elements is implemented as an external function
   and a manual adjoint is implemented for the reverse path.
