## 💻 Example

Calculate first-order derivatives of an arbitrary function with two inputs and one output using XAD in adjoint mode.

```c++
Adouble x0 = 1.3;              // initialise inputs
Adouble x1 = 5.2;  
tape.registerInput(x0);        // register independent variables
tape.registerInput(x1);        // with the tape
tape.newRecording();           // start recording derivatives
Adouble y = func(x0, x1);      // run main function
tape.registerOutput(y);        // register the output variable
derivative(y) = 1.0;           // seed output adjoint to 1.0
tape.computeAdjoints();        // roll back adjoints to inputs
cout << "dy/dx0=" << derivative(x0) << "\n"
     << "dy/dx1=" << derivative(x1) << "\n";
```
